# Heatmap Canvas Overlay - GoogleMaps

This project is an example of how to integrate a custom heatmap drawn on Canvas element along with GoogleMaps. Stencil is used as demonstration of
developing a reusable componenten for other projects.

As a key difference from other heatmaps, data points may have different radius. In this case, a user database is used where each node has set his own radius as an active area so the map represents the level of coverage of a region by the users availability.

Heatmap is drawn firstly as a gray gray scale and colorized as final step. They gray areas are drawn using an auxiliar canvas of a circle with gradiant shadow:

Colorization is made using another auxiliar canvas as color palette, reading the pixels of it depending on level of gray in each pinxel of the original gray scale canvas.
